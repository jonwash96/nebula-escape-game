## Inspiration

*Minor Spoiler alert! Star Trek Fans beware*
Nebula Escape is based on an episode of Star Trek Picard where Picard & Riker loose a space battle and find themselves sinking into a gravity well at the centre of a nebula. Riker is the captain and he's tasked with doing all that he can to keep the crew alive for as long as possible, despite the grim, seemingly fatal conditions. 

Amongst all the chaos, Dr. Crusher uses a powerful combination of her motherly intuition combined with her sharp analytical skills and discovers that the gravity source is actually pulsing waves of energy that the ship would be able ride like waves on an ocean, while also absorbing its radiation to recharge the core and power up the engines to get free. 

They're able to manage the recharge, restoring power to the ship and use the energy wave to build momentum and cary them away from the gravity well, but it's not over yet. They still need to chart a course through an asteroid field and destroy the ship to whom they'd initially lost the battle— The Shrike— prowling on the other side of the asteroid field. 

Eventually they make it through, immobilize the enemy ship, and warp back to friendly territories.

## Gameplay

### Narrative:
You are a Starfleet captain and you've found yourself in dire circumstances. You've just lost the previous battle, and are now sinking through a nebula toward a mysterious gravity source. You must make a series of difficult life or death decisions in an attempt to save the lives of your crew, or at least prolong them for as long as possible, holding out for the mere chance that another starfleet ship happens to receive one of your hails.

To do this, you must reflect on your past experiences reigning victorious in previous battles. The will to survive in this case is as much a mental challenge as it is an operational one.

- Throughout the game, Every time you or the enemy lands a hit, you also receive information from your crew about the status of your ship in the moment. You must respond to a decision-prompt to remedy the situation.
    - If an enemy lands a hit, it's bad news.
    - If you land a hit, it's good news.
- The game is not won by winning Battleship; You must first win Battleship by sinking all of your enemy's ships to have a chance of escaping.

## How to Play Nebula Escape
- How to Play Nebula Escape
- Nebula Escape is a Star Trek themed Battleships-like role-playing boardgame, using rules similar to the Salvo edition of Battleships.
- Players begin by setting up their ships on the battlefield in 90 degree orientations.
-  Once ships are placed, If story-mode is selected, the game will navigate to a piece of the story.
- The story is configured for the first player, while the second player plays the part of the enemy in battle.
- Both users can choose either opposite sides, or the same side (Starfleet or Enemy).
- Once the game begins, players take turns firing shots at their opponent to try & destroy their ships.
- The opponent's board will be in subpace mode, allowing the player taking their turn to only see the hits & misses. 
- Before a user takes their turn, both boards will automatically enter subspace mode, and the player will be prompted either to enter their password, or to press a button to take their turn. This prevents the other player from cheating.
- Each turn, exactly 5 shots must be placed on the opponent's board. You will not be allowed to fire with more or less. Should you need to remove a shot, simply click it again to do so.
- You can place more shots if you're thinking, and remove the extra ones when you're ready to fire.
- When the shot count is satisied, the fire button becomes active. Once you press it, your board will automatically enter subspace mode, and a dialog will prompt you to continue the attack so that both players can watch as the shots are fired and evaluated.
- Once all shots have been fired, a summary will appear at the top of the screen, and each shot will be recorded in the player's summary panel, along with achievements.
- Achievements follow the story, and include the following:
    - First Blood: When the first ship is hit
    - First Sunken Ship: When the first ship is sunk
    - Turning Point: When 3/5 ships are sunk
    - Victory In Sight: When 4/5 ships are sunk (Called Event Horizon if the enemy gets the achievement)
    - And finally, winning the game (whether for the story-mode player or their opponent)
- Each of the achievements takes you to the story mode, where a short narrative is read, and you are prompted to select from a list to make a decision.
- Snippets of the story are reflected on the game dashboard after each one.
- The game is won by the first player to sink all 5 of the enemy's ships.
- Upon winning or losing the game, there is a final Piece of the story to indulge, before returning back to the dashboard for a game summary. where you can view the final board and review each hit.
