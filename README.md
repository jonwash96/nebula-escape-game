## Inspiration

*Minor Spoiler alert! Star Trek Fans beware*
Nebula Escape is based on an episode of Star Trek Picard where Picard & Riker loose a space battle and find themselves sinking into a gravity well at the centre of a nebula. Riker is the captain and he's tasked with doing all that he can to keep the crew alive for as long as possible, despite the grim, seemingly fatal conditions. 

Amongst all the chaos, Dr. Crusher uses a powerful combination of her motherly intuition combined with her sharp analytical skills and discovers that the gravity source is actually pulsing waves of energy that the ship would be able ride like waves on an ocean, while also absorbing its radiation to recharge the core and power up the engines to get free. 

They're able to manage the recharge, restoring power to the ship and use the energy wave to build momentum and cary them away from the gravity well, but it's not over yet. They still need to chart a course through an asteroid field and destroy the ship to whom they'd initially lost the battle— The Shrike— prowling on the other side of the asteroid field. 

Eventually they make it through, immobilize the enemy ship, and warp back to friendly territories.

## Gameplay

### Narrative:
You are a Starfleet captain and you've found yourself in dire circumstances. You've just lost the previous battle, and are now sinking through a nebula toward a mysterious gravity source. You must make a series of difficult life or death decisions in an attempt to save the lives of your crew, or at least prolong them for as long as possible, holding out for the mere chance that another starfleet ship happens to receive one of your hails.

To do this, you must reflect on your past experiences reigning victorious in previous battles. The will to survive in this case is as much a mental challenge as it is an operational one.

- Throughout the game, Every time you or the enemy lands a hit, you also receive information from your crew about the status of your ship in the moment. You must respond to a decision-prompt to remedy the situation.
    - If an enemy lands a hit, it's bad news.
    - If you land a hit, it's good news.
- The game is not won by winning Battleship; You must first win Battleship by sinking all of your enemy's ships to have a chance of escaping.
