    <h1>How to Play Nebula Escape</h1>
    <p>Nebula Escape is a Star Trek themed Battleships-like role-playing boardgame, using rules similar to the Salvo edition of Battleships.</p>
    <p>Players begin by setting up their ships on the battlefield in 90 degree orientations.</p>
    <p>Once ships are placed, if story-mode is selected, the game will navigate to a piece of the story.</p>
    <p>The story is configured for the first player, while the second player plays the part of the enemy in battle.</p>
    <p>Both users can choose either opposite sides, or the same side (Starfleet or Enemy).</p>
    <p>Once the game begins, players take turns firing shots at their opponent to try &amp; destroy their ships.</p>
    <p>The opponent's board will be in subspace mode, allowing the player taking their turn to only see the hits &amp; misses.</p>
    <p>Before a user takes their turn, both boards will automatically enter subspace mode, and the player will be prompted either to enter their password, or to press a button to take their turn. This prevents the other player from cheating.</p>
    <p>Each turn, exactly 5 shots must be placed on the opponent's board. You will not be allowed to fire with more or less. Should you need to remove a shot, simply click it again to do so.</p>
    <p>You can place more shots if you're thinking, and remove the extra ones when you're ready to fire.</p>
    <p>When the shot count is satisfied, the fire button becomes active. Once you press it, your board will automatically enter subspace mode, and a dialog will prompt you to continue the attack so that both players can watch as the shots are fired and evaluated.</p>
    <p>Once all shots have been fired, a summary will appear at the top of the screen, and each shot will be recorded in the player's summary panel, along with achievements.</p>
    <p>Achievements follow the story, and include the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First Blood: When the first ship is hit</li>
        <li>First Sunken Ship: When the first ship is sunk</li>
        <li>Turning Point: When 3/5 ships are sunk</li>
        <li>Victory In Sight: When 4/5 ships are sunk (Called Event Horizon if the enemy gets the achievement)</li>
        <li>And finally, winning the game (whether for the story-mode player or their opponent)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each of the achievements takes you to the story mode, where a short narrative is read, and you are prompted to select from a list to make a decision.</p>
    <p>Snippets of the story are reflected on the game dashboard after each one.</p>
    <p>The game is won by the first player to sink all 5 of the enemy's ships.</p>
    <p>Upon winning or losing the game, there is a final piece of the story to indulge, before returning back to the dashboard for a game summary, where you can view the final board and review each hit.</p>
    <p>See the Controls section for how to operate the interface.</p>
